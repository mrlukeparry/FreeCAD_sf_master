Geoff,

My friend, Dan Falck, from Portland Oregon, is asking about your geometry code that I released in my HeeksCNC project.
It looks like we put "BSD license", but it is more normal to put "New BSD license".
I think the difference is the removal of a clause about having to include an acknowledgement of the original source in all advertising material.
I presume you don't mind if we change it from "BSD" to "New BSD"?
